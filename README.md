# bachelor-project-gitmoji
To make my life as a bachelor writing student a little brighter I have decided to use gitmoji in my commits. The standard ones for development are unfortuneatly not good for writing, hence I needed to make my own. They will be VERY specific to what I'm doing with classification of skin lesions, but feel free to get inspired.
